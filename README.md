# EC1B1
All of the instructions for what we are meant to do for the project will be listed here and (in more detail) on the Google Doc
• Timelines. Final submission of the coursework is due in W9, Wednesday 13th March by 22:00. Penalties will be applied for late submission, please liaise with the course manager if you encounter any major issues. 
∗ W5: Assigned groups and countries 
∗ W6: First meeting, division of tasks, data cleaning 
∗ W7: Second meeting, data “sense check”, answering 5.1 & 5.2, producing figures 
∗ W8: Third meeting, review of figures, finalising answers to 5.3, final review


Key sections:

• Reading the paper and general instructions: To be done by all
– Read Section 2 carefully, skim introduction (contains extra technical details) 

• Cleaning: Jayden
– Getting the right dataset 
– Converting in to form ready for analysis 

• Doing the analysis: Andy and Harry
– Take standard deviations etc 
– Well documented code 
– Discussing your results 

• Plotting: Lewis
– Good graphics are key 

Marking criteria

• Many ways to do things well 
– No “right way” to do data analysis 
– We will grade based on quality of answers 

• E.g. well documented code, high quality and creative graphics 
– We will deduct relatively few marks for minor coding errors

• Grading. When working with data, there is no “right answer”. There are often many valid ways
to proceed and our marking will be cognisant of this.
– This coursework will account for 15% of your total EC1B1 grade. Your work will
be graded based on:
1. How well documented and clear the code is (20%)
2. The quality of your responses to the questions in Section 5.1 (15%)
3. The quality of your responses to the questions in Section 5.2 (5%)
4. The quality of your figures and responses to the questions in Section 5.3 (35%)
∗ You should ensure your graphs follow principles of good graphical design (see Schwabish (2014)) and that your tables are well formatted
5. The quality of your responses to the questions in Section 5.4 (20%)
6. Whether your results seem reasonable and are in the right “ballpark” (5%)
∗ Note that we will not deduct marks if your graph or numerical values are not exactly
identical to ours

Submission
• Submission materials. One member from each group needs to upload all the following documents onto the Moodle submission portal: 

(i) A notebook containing all code and outputs as a .ipynb file 
∗ This needs to show the code for your data cleaning and also include any code to generate graphs you use in your answers. 
∗ Ensure your notebook is well commented. Be clear what your code is doing and how the outputs you present are generated. 
∗ Ensure that another user will be able to easily run your code. Either host you data on a cloud server (like Github), or include clear instructions for exactly what data should be downloaded and from where, as well as what file path it should have. 

(ii) A pdf file containing the answers to all the questions presented in ‘Section 5 - Questions and Discussion’ 1 
∗ You should include your graphs where relevant. 
∗ Markers will be rewarding precision both in your written responses and your figures, not length. 

(iii) The completed coursework submission coversheet, signed by all group members

Key tasks to complete (by member):
For all:
• Read the Introduction and Section 2 of “Mussa Puzzle Redux” by Oleg Itskokhi and Dmitry Mukhin! 
• Read “An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data” by Jonathan Schwabish
